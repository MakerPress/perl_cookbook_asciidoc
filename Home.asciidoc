This is a random sampling of recipes from the Perl Cookbook by Tom Christiansen and Nat Torkington.  It's a total experiment, so take this stuff for granted for now!!!

This is the index page that is used to glue all the separate files into a single book project.  You can use this page to build a PDF or EPUB.  We're working on having these generate using the "official" O'Reilly templates:

* [[ Main book include file | cookbook_INDEX ]]

Here are the various recipes.  We're starting with a sampling and see where we get.
